## How to play

Navigate through the labyrinth to find the hidden exit (â˜…) while gathering letters to form words. Watch your step count, each move costs one precious step. Don't worry though! You can form words to earn more steps and boost your score. The longer your words, the higher your score climbs. Plan your route wisely, explore every corner, and turn those scattered letters into lexical gold as you hunt for the elusive exit.
